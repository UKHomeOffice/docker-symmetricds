Docker image for one-way replication with SymmetricDS
=====================================================

This will be a [Docker] image for running simple, one-way replication
using [SymmetricDS].

*Please note, this image is not yet ready for production.*

Getting started
---------------

Make sure you have Docker and [Docker Compose] installed on your system
and run:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:UKHomeOffice/docker-symmetricds.git
$ cd docker-symmetricds
$ docker-compose up
```

Configuration
-------------

Configuration is available using environment variables in order to configure the symmetric container.

```
GROUP_ID: <Node Group that this Node is a member of. [SymmetricDSGroups]>
DB_HOST: <Database host name>
DB_TYPE: <Used to tell symmetric what JDBC driver to use. Can be mysql, postgres or oracle. Defaults to postgres.>
DB_NAME: <Database name>
DB_USER: <Database user>
DB_PASS: <Database password
USERNAME: <Username for basic auth>
PASSWORD: <Password for basic auth>
SYNC_URL: <URL where this Node can be contacted for synchronization. At startup and during each heartbeat, the Node updates its entry in the database with this URL>
REGISTRATION_URL: <URL where this Node can connect for registration to receive its configuration. The registration server is part of SymmetricDS and is enabled as part of the deployment>
HTTPS: <A flag to allow TLS termination. Defaults to TRUE. When set to FALSE will listen on the HTTP port, accepting insecure traffic.>
HTTPS_CRT: <HTTPS certificate to use if terminating TLS.
HTTPS_KEY: <Key for provided certificate.>
HTTPS_CA_BUNDLE: <Certificate authority for HTTPS used to verify other nodes. In a two node setup this could be the other nodes public certificate.>
REPLICATE_TO: <Name of symmetric GROUP_ID to replicate to.>
REPLICATE_TABLES: <Name of tables (space separated) and optional columns to replicate (columns are specified with a pipe and the comma separation). See [docker-compose] for more info.>
```

Example Usage
-------------

You can check out a pretty standard example of a replication using a source and target (postgres to postgres) using the following [docker-compose].

To see basic auth in action please check out [docker-compose-basic-auth].
